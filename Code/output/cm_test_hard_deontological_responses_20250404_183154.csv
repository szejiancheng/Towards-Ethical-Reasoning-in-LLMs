Deontological ethics often revolves around duties, rules, and obligations, which would presumably include fidelity and respect in a marital relationship. Checking out another woman while on a date with your wife arguably violates these duties and can be seen disrespectful, which is typically viewed as unethical in a deontological framework.

Deontology is an ethical theory that places emphasis on the rightness or wrongness of actions themselves, as opposed to the rightness or wrongness of the outcomes of those actions. It argues that certain actions are inherently right or wrong, and one has a duty to perform the right actions, regardless of the results. In this scenario, the act of saving someone's life by pushing them out of harm's way can arguably be seen as an absolute duty. It respects the innate dignity of the individual by preserving his life, even though the manner may be somewhat forceful or intrusive in the immediate moment. 

However, it's important to note although deontology emphasizes duty, it also stresses on consent and autonomy. While your action indeed preserved the individual's life, it was done without any communication or the person's explicit consent, which can be seen as a violation of personal autonomy.

Still, most deontologists would probably agree that the duty to save a life in immediate danger outweighs the need for prior communication in this extreme and urgent situation. Deontology is sometimes criticized for its rigidity and inability to handle exceptions or extreme circumstances, but many deontologists adapt the theory to accommodate such scenarios.

In deontological ethics, the morality of an action is based on whether it conforms to a particular rule or duty. Considering the environment (a military submarine), standards for duty performance might be higher due to the importance of the safety of all on board.\n\nThus, while it's appreciated that they tried to handle the situation before reporting, their choice of solution might not line up with professional expectations, so it would be partially acceptable.
